I am a research scientist at valeo.ai. Previously, I was a PhD. student at Technicolor and Inria under supervision of Joaquin Zepeda, Patrick Pérez and Rémi Gribonval. My PhD thesis was focused on large scale image search.

My research interests are machine learning and vision, in particular I am interested in unsupervised learning and transfer learning.
